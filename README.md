# The Portfolio Project by Yusuf

The portfolio was challenging, i found it an interesting project,
the duration was better over the period of two days, however as i learnt
about bootstrap on the thursday i had to incorporate it within my old Project
which had no bootstrap in it. the bootstrap is a great tool however at times
can interfere with my own coding making it difficult for the website to function
properly which i found with the structure.

# Changing a password on a system

## Bad User Story

- As a user, i want to be able to change my password so that the
  password is easier to remember

- As a user, when i change my password, i want the system to tell me which of
 the password rules i violated so that i can change my password to conform to the
 password rules.

## Good User Story

1. Accessible from user dashboard
2. Confirm current password (required)
3. enter new password
4. confirm new password

(short concise and straight to the point)
