# The Portfolio Project by Yusuf

The portfolio was challenging, i found it an interesting project,
the duration was better over the period of two days, however as i learnt
about bootstrap on the thursday i had to incorporate it within my old Project
which had no bootstrap in it. the bootstrap is a great tool however at times
can interfere with my own coding making it difficult for the website to function
properly which i found with the structure.
